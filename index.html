    <h1>Hi, I'm Lys, From Agadir, Morocco.</h1>

    <p>
      My full name is Iliass Hajji, I'm a front-end web developer with a background in graphic and logo design, and I'm
      looking to
      further enhance web development skills.
    </p>

    <p>I was born and raised in Morocco, I lived in many cities in Morocco throughout my life.</p>

    <!-- Video Games story later -->
    <p>
      I've always been fascinated with computer and I always want to dive deep in how things work like the internet and
      computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my journey learning web development, I learned that there is nothing magical about computers and the internet,
      only
      a meticulous interplay of logical procedures, and complex communication between hardware and software.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that nothing is beyond the grasp of learning if you break each difficult concept into its smallest,
      understandable and comprehensible element. This way of thinking served as guideline principle for me to learn the
      things I know, and will always do for the things I want to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      By breaking down complex ideas into manageable fragments, I've found that even the most difficult concepts that I
      encountered and that previously I thought were impossible, became accessible and understandable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I maintain my personal website, and I also build and maintain other study projects that you can find in
      my
      <a href="">GitHub</a> account.
    </p>

    <p>I'm always down to collaborate when I'm free. <a href="">Contact me</a> if you have any questions.</p>
